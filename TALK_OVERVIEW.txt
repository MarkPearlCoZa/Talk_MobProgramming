Mark Pearl, a dev lead at MYOB, has offered to share some of the experiences his team has had over the last 6 months with Mob Programming. He'll cover the benefits, techniques they have used, and some of the challenges they’ve faced.

For those not familiar with Mob Programming, it is a new software development technique where a team of developers works at one computer solving one problem.  It can be seen as an evolutionary step forward from Pair Programming - with it’s own set of challenges and benefits.

Mob Programming is a new software development technique where a group of people work at one computer solving one problem. It can be seen as an evolutionary step forward from Pair Programming - with it’s own set of challenges and benefits. It accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, collective code ownership and flow to name a few. The outcome of Mob Programming is outstanding software produced by teams, this includes:

- Fewer defects
- Increased flow
- Reduced key man dependencies
- Increased learning
- Better code
- More fun

One of MYOB's teams (based in Auckland) have been using Mob Programming for the last 6 months. Mark Pearl, the Dev Lead of the team, has offered to share some of the experiences they have had so far, the benefits, techniques they have used, and some of the challenges they’ve faced.

We’ve found the outcome of Mob Programming is outstanding software produced by teams. Software that has fewer defects, higher productivity and ultimately a higher return on investment.
