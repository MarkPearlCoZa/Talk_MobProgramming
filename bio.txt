Mark Pearl, a dev lead at MYOB, has offered to share some of the experiences his team has had over the last 6 months with Mob Programming. He'll cover the benefits, techniques they have used, and some of the challenges they’ve faced.

For those not familiar with Mob Programming, it is a new software development technique where a team of developers works at one computer solving one problem.  It can be seen as an evolutionary step forward from Pair Programming - with it’s own set of challenges and benefits.

Mob Programming is a new software development technique where a group of people work at one computer solving one problem. It can be seen as an evolutionary step forward from Pair Programming - with it’s own set of challenges and benefits. It accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, collective code ownership and flow to name a few. The outcome of Mob Programming is outstanding software produced by teams, this includes:

- Fewer defects
- Increased flow
- Reduced key man dependencies
- Increased learning
- Better code
- More fun
